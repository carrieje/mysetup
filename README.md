Various config files I use

What it really is
=================

This is highly personal config files.
In the sense that I will not try to make them fit your needs, but only mines.
I am though interested in any comments you would find useful, and up to answer your questions or remarks.

You are free to fork this repo to make your own.

Howto
=====

If you want to use my config files, follow these easy steps :

1. git clone https://github.com/carrieje/mysetup.git
2. cd mysetup
2. ./setup.sh (must be ran into the git repo you have just cloned)
3. Enjoy a fresh and homogenous working environment

Disclaimer & Warnings
=====================

The setup script might overwrite your existing config files (e.g ~/.indent.pro).
It does not make any copy of the files it destroys.
This could be an future enhancement.

I am not responsible for the use you make of these materials.
You are the only responsible for it.
